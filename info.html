    <h1>Shrödinger's Advent calendar, open one box every day!</h1>
    <p>Learn about quantum physics while you wait for Santa :D </p>

    <p>The Shrödinger's Advent calendar was created as a part of the Quantum Games course in Aalto University.
      We had to make a game or art project that was inspired by quantum physics.
      I made an Advent calendar where Schrödinger's cat (either dead or alive) tells you fun facts about quantum physics.
